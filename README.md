## General Information
- This project aims to understand and predict bike-sharing demand based on various factors like weather conditions, season, and user type.
- The business problem addressed is optimizing resource allocation for bike-sharing services by accurately forecasting demand.
- The dataset used is the publicly available **Bike Sharing Dataset**, which includes daily data on bike rentals, weather, and user statistics.

## Conclusions
- **Season and Weather**: Bike demand is higher in summer and fall (pleasant weather) and lower during winter and severe weather conditions.
- **Registered Users**: Registered users have a higher correlation with total bike demand compared to casual users.
- **Temperature**: Temperature significantly affects bike rentals, with higher demand observed on warmer days.
- **Categorical Variables**: Proper encoding of categorical variables (e.g., `season`, `weathersit`) improves the modelâ€™s performance (R-squared: 0.856).

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- pandas 1.x
- numpy 1.x
- scikit-learn 1.x
- seaborn 0.x
- matplotlib 3.x

## Acknowledgements
